# Mantid-pre-commit

Repository for storing pre commits for [Mantid](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid).

## Pre-commits
- ``mantid-release-note-check``: Checks and replaces any bottom level release notes using the ``*`` or ``+`` bullet point styles instead of the standard ``-``. This is to avoid Sphinx warnings when combining release notes into one file.
